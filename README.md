# Clocktower Homebrew Stuff

[`icons`](../main/icons) contains some icons I made for use in the [Online Blood on the Clocktower Grimoire](https://clocktower.online/)
for some of the official experimental characters that haven't been added, as well as a few of my own.
I am not a graphics designer and I made these in about 3 seconds using Keynote.

[`custom_definitions`](../main/custom_definitions) contains character text and almanac entries for my homebrew characters,
as well as JSON definitions for the apps.

Soon, I'll add some of my custom scripts here too.

I am not associated/affilated with the [Pandemonium Institute](https://bloodontheclocktower.com/about-us) or the Online Grimoire in any way.
