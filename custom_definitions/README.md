# Custom Definitions

Custom characters that I've created for my games. Icons for these characters can be found in the `icons` directory.

## Editor

"When a player leaves the game, the Storyteller gains their ability until they die."

Use the Editor in a Teensyville game where some players have to travel, but doing so would be too powerful for the good team.

- The Storyteller "gaining the ability" works similarly to the **Plague Doctor** in that they don't
  become the alignment of the player who left, they don't become a player who can be targeted by abilities,
  and they cannot vote or nominate.
- The player who left does not die.
- If the player who left dies, the Storyteller loses their ability.
- In order to execute the player who left, the other players nominate _them_, not the Storyteller.

### Examples

> On the first day of a five-player game, Jeremy (the **Cerenovus**) has to leave. Each night afterwards,
> the Storyteller chooses someone to be mad using the **Cerenovus**' ability.

> The **Virgin** (who is yet to be nominated) leaves. The next day, a Townsfolk nominates
> the **Virgin** and dies.

> The **Vortox** leaves. Each night afterwards, the Storyteller chooses a player to die, and gives
> false info to all Townsfolk. On the final day, the **Vortox** is executed. Good wins.

### Explanation

A five-player game with a Traveller is too powerful for the good team, since that Traveller is
basically guaranteed to be good, and the number of players who can be the Demon is now four instead of five.

With an Editor in play, every player can have a normal character's ability (including being the Demon!)
without worring if leaving will guarantee a loss or the use of the **Fiddler**.
